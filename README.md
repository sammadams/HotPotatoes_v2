# HotPotatoes_v2
Hot Potatoes JS update for mobile-friendly UI/UX and score recording

# History
In February 2018, I (Sam) worked with a group of Brazilian EFL teachers in a low-tech environment. Their students have smartphones with built-in browsers but the local infrastructure doesn't have stable network connections. The intermittent internet connection creates limitations for what teachers are able to do with their students. I saw a opportunity to repurpose Hot Potatoes since the small HTML files would allow for quick device-to-device transfer via local wifi; moreover, the HotPot creation interface is accessible for teachers and a large repository of guides in multiple languages already exists.

# Current Problems
>1. UI display issues
Hot Potatoes was created for devices with large screens, so the hardcoded px styling does not look good on mobile devices.

>2. Incompatibliity with touchscreens

>3. Older media player tags for video/audio

>4. Score recording
